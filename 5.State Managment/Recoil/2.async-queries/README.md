- All state management tools help you to divide your project into 2 parts => state (store) and components

## Recoil
- RecoilRoot  (wrapper component to provide recoil logic to the children)
- atom
- useRecoilState  (similar to useState)
- useRecoilValue  (just the value)
- useSetRecoilState (just the setting up)
- selector (is derived from other atoms)
### atom
- It stores the state
- can be defined outside the component
- can be teleported to any component
